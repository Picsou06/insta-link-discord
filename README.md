## üîß Troubleshooting

### Connection errors
- **400 Bad Request "update Instagram"**: This is a common Instagram API message, often resolved by retrying
- **429 Too Many Requests**: Temporary rate limiting, wait a few minutes before retrying
- Check your Instagram credentials in the `.env` file
- Make sure two-factor authentication is disabled on your Instagram account
- Try logging into Instagram manually from the same network
- If session issues persist, delete `instagram-session.json` and restart

### Discord webhook errors
- Check that the webhook URL is correct
- Make sure the webhook hasn't been deleted
- Check bot permissions on the Discord server

### Polling errors (500 Internal Server Error, 403 Forbidden)
- **500 errors**: Usually indicate Instagram rate limiting
- **403 Forbidden errors**: May indicate temporary Instagram restrictions or account limitations
- The bot automatically pauses and notifies on Discord after too many errors
- Try increasing polling delays in the `.env` file
- If errors persist, wait some time before restarting (Instagram may have imposed temporary restrictions)

### Deprecated packages warnings
If you see deprecated package warnings during installation:
- These warnings are mostly from Instagram API dependencies
- They don't affect the bot's functionality

### Missing dependencies errors
If you encounter "Cannot find module" errors:
- Make sure all dependencies are installed with: `npm install @discordjs/collection jimp get-urls@10.0.1 instagram-private-api@1.41.0 instagram_mqtt@0.2.16`
- These packages are required by the Instagram.js library but may not be automatically installed
- **Important**: Use the exact versions specified, as newer versions have compatibility issues

### ESM compatibility issues
If you see errors like "ERR_REQUIRE_ESM":
- This occurs when ESM-only packages are installed instead of CommonJS compatible versions
- Solution: Uninstall the problematic package and install the correct version specified above
- Example: `npm uninstall get-urls && npm install get-urls@10.0.1`

### Collection import errors
If you see "Collection is not a constructor":
- This indicates an incorrect import of the @discordjs/collection package
- The fix has been applied to use destructured imports: `const { Collection } = require('@discordjs/collection')`

### Instagram API restrictions (403 Forbidden)
If you see repeated 403 Forbidden errors:
- **Most common cause**: Version incompatibility between `instagram_mqtt` and `instagram-private-api`
- **Primary solution**: Ensure correct package versions are installed:
  ```bash
  npm uninstall instagram_mqtt instagram-private-api
  npm install instagram_mqtt@0.2.16 instagram-private-api@1.41.0
  ```
- **Other potential causes:**
  - Instagram may have detected automated activity and imposed temporary restrictions
  - Session corruption - try deleting `instagram-session.json` and restart
  - Network issues or proxy problems
- **Additional solutions:**
  - Wait several hours before restarting the bot
  - Increase polling delays significantly in the `.env` file
  - Try logging into Instagram manually from the same IP address
- The bot will automatically pause after 10 consecutive errors and send a notification to Discord
